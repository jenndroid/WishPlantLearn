A place to record plants you've bought, plants you want, and what you've learned all in one place!  
Built with Django and Python, soundtracked by NTS' Memory Lane Infinite Mixtape.  
You will need to create a .env file with a SECRET_KEY value in it to run this project locally.   
Modified from the Learning Log project by Eric Matthes.
